TODO:
- make `value` and `context` types somehow no longer mutually recursive with
  other main SMLSyntax types
  * split most types in SMLSyntax into a `semantics` folder, such as tyval,
    type_scheme, sigval, etc
- fix Ehole by coming up with a better, less hacky solution
  * potentially duplicate `exp` type for purely location purposes
- reduce interface bloat of Context module
- move to CM instead of MLton?
  * but, lose fixity across files? pervasives.sml?
- update parse-sml version
